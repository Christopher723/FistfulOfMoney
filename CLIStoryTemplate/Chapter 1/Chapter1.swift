    print("Once upon a time, there was a developer named \(mainCharacter). \(mainCharacter) walked into town and there were people fighting. In the heart of Detroit, a battle was brewing. Ohio Cleveland Brown fans were concentrated in the downtown because the Lions had entered the Super Bowl against them. The game was tied, and with all of the money on the line, the fans were fighting out an ending of their own. With the stands in such a mess the game was called off , and the stadium evacuated. All over downtown Detroit, Michiganders battled the Cleveland Brown fans attempting to bring home the win for their team. \(mainCharacter) was walking home from work at the Apple Developer Academy, when they got hit in the head with the Lombardi trophy.")
